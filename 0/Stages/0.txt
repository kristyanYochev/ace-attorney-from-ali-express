Good morning or evening or afternoon, welcome to AliExpress Ace Attorney.
I will be training you to do a job that normally takes 8 years in less than a minute.
Good luck, it's not like innocent people’s lives could be changed today or anything.
Please read through the details that [2] has provided for you, he’s going easy on you today. 
<2>
Today's your first case, don't be nervous, I've already compiled all the evidence for you.
The victim for this case is Mr [3]. 
He was stabbed three times with a knife, and subsequently died of blood loss.
The body was found in the living room, on the floor in front of the television.
The murder is thought to of occured Wednesday the 23rd of June between 9 and 12 PM.
The prime suspect is Mr [4] who was seen entering the victims house at 8 PM but it is unknown when he left.
The murder weapon was found discarded in the kitchen sink.
That's all we've got unfortunately, hopefully it's enough to get a clean prosecution.

'At court'
<5>
The time is [TIME], the court is now in session. Please do not leave the courtroom without having given prior notice.
We are here to decide the fate of Mr [4], who is the prime suspect of the murder of Mr [3].
First let's hear Mr [4]'s statement.
<4>
I'm telling you I don't know what happened. All I did was visit my good friend and suddenly I'm accused of murder!
But fine, here's what happened.
[3] had invited me over to catch up, I arrived at about 8 PM.
I didn't bring anything with me, definitely not anything dangerous like a knife.
We had some drinks, had a nice evening, and then I left. That's it. He was perfectly alive at 12:30 when I went home.
It was just the two of us for the evening, nice and quiet.
I would have stayed longer but he'd fallen asleep on the sofa watching television so I just let myself out.
Whoever killed him must have done it after I left. I have nothing to do with this.

The whole job entails listening to the defendants argument and calling them out on discrepancies.
Use the arrow keys to cycle through the defendant's argument, and press [KEY] to select a statement that you believe contains false information.
Accuse the defendant wrongly more than 3 times and you put our top quality law firms reputation on the line.
Therefore you will get no pay, seems fair to me. Remember, we don't really want high level criminals out on the streets.

{WIN}
<1>
Hold on Mr [4]. You say you left the house at 12:30, correct?
<4>
That is what I said, yes.
<1>
The Coroner's report shows the victim was dead by 12 at the latest and 9 at the earliest. By your own testimony you were with the victim for this entire time.
Meaning you were there when they were killed, since you said no one else was there, you must be the killer!
<5>
This is compelling evidence, what do you have to say about this?
<4>
I-I-I... 
...
...
I KILLED HIM- OF COURSE I DID! HE DESERVED IT! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
<5>
With the confession the court can be adjourned. That is all.

Day 1 complete, you put the guy behind bars right? Murr Durman, what a name.
Your job is basically going to be doing that over and over and over again.
But you get paid for what is essentially playing ‘find the pair’, so it’s not too bad. 
I wonder what the next guy is gonna be called, Des Troy? Kill Erman?
In any case, I’m sure you will continue improving your reputation in the courtroom.

{FAIL}
<5>
Does the prosecution not have a rebuttal? In that case there is insufficient evidence to find Mr [4] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
Mr [4] is free to go, that is all for today.
<0>
Day 1 complete, well, barely. You let Murr Durman go. Murr Durman. Read that slowly, out loud.
Maybe you did need more than a minute of training afterall.
Don’t worry, we won’t kick you out quite yet, Dave over there once let a guy go who still had blood on his shirt.
