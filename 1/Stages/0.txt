A nondescript, unimportant office building has recently been the victim of a hate crime, apparently the arsonist really didn’t appreciate the stunning 60s grey architecture.
My boss has just sent you the details, same as last time, read the case details carefully and argue with the defendant.
It’s a bit like what happened last night in the pub except everyone’s wearing suits and Gary isn’t dancing on the table.
Well, looks like your boss needs you, better go see what he wants.

Right, this might be a little trickier than last time.
You know the global computer company Doors? One of their office buildings was set fire too from the inside.
The fire was started using the gas in the company kitchen as well as additional fuel.
The suspect, [3]'s, ID card was found in the remains of the kitchen by the stove.
Every employee has and ID card as they are needed to enter the building.
The fire started Tuesday evening at 8 PM.
Recently the company made a lot of employees redundant so there is possibility of a suspect among them.
The kitchen where the fire started is on the 6th floor.

'At court'

Please be seated, the court is now in session.
On Tuesday 11th November one of the head Doors offices was set alight.
We have one of a number of suspects here with us today. Defendant, please state your case.

You're really falling for their tricks? Isn't it obvious I'm being framed!?
Do you really think I'm stupid enough to leave my ID card where I started a fire???
Obviously someone took my ID on Monday when I was leaving the building and used to to frame me.
Once they had my ID it would have been easy to just leave the gas running in the kitchen then- Boom!
My guess is it's one of those guys who were made redundant- trying to get revenge on the company an' all that.
Really, it couldn't have been me I left work early on Tuesday, I wasn't anywhere near the building at 8.
All I did was clock in, do my work, then go home. No fire starting whatsoever.
Whoever did this though, they must be smart, a real criminal genius.
I mean, doing this when everyone was just let off AND framing me? Smart.

{WIN}

I got it! You say your ID was taken from you on Monday, yes?
<3>
Yep, the arsonist must have got it from me then.
<1>
Then how did you get into the building on Tuesday when all employees need a ID card to enter?
<3>
Ah umm haha well... I guess I was mistaken.
In that case I don't know when my ID was taken from me- but it definitely was! Because I don't have it now!
<4>
Mr [3] you don't have it now because it was found at the crime scene.
Court will reconvene after a short break.

{FAIL}
Ooooh unlucky, just a quick note, we kind of made your job a tad harder, this time we need to find 3 pieces of evidence.
I hope you’re ready for this job to throw some curveballs your way.
