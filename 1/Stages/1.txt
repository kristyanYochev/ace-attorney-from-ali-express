Good job out there. We've had some more information delivered, let me fill you in.
We have his bank account details showing he bought a considerable amount of petrol on Monday evening.
Also we can confirm he left the building early on Tuesday, however it's possible he got back in when someone was leaving.
We also know he was in the kitchen both Monday evening and Tuesday morning from witness recounts.
Also to refresh you the fire was started at 8 PM.
And the kitchen is on the 6th floor.

The court is now back in session. [3] Can you explain how your ID was found at the scene of the crime?
<3>
Look, maybe they took my ID from me when I was in Tuesday morning, or maybe I just dropped it there.
Just because it was there doesn't show I was there at 8 PM and it doesn't show I started the fire!
As I said before I had to leave early to go shopping and charge my car. I wasn't even at the building at 8!
How can you not see someone is framing me!
Sure I've been to the kitchen before! Everyone has, that doesn't mean I'm guilty.

Just one question [3], do you have an electric car?
<3>
Ah yes, I do. I don't see how that's relevant?
<1>
If your car is electric, why did you buy so much petrol Monday evening? Was it to perhaps start a fire?
<3>
What!? I- Umm- Err- NO! It was just, just, just...
<4>
[3] could you please answer the question, for what reason did you buy petrol on Monday evening?
<3>
FINE. YOU GOT ME. CAN YOU BLAME ME!? 
I worked for TEN YEARS I gave them my LIFE and what do they do in return!?
MINIMUM WAGE and NO BENEFITS! Then they go making people redundant and I just KNOW I was going to be next!
They DESERVED it!

Alright I think we've heard enough. Court is adjourned.

“We didn’t start the fire”, well, no, but BLAZE did. He turned Doors into Floors.
What a surprise, it’s almost like the game writer is having too much fun with these names.
I’m sure the next case will have another humorous name, something related to burglary, Robb Banks would work.

Ah so close, yet so far. To do this job you really have to have a burning desire to find the smallest of details.
Give it a look again, remember, each time you make a mistake you lose some of your pay packet.
